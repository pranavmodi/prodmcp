Read More Anna Deepti Gopaluni We have been chocolate therapy family for over 6 years now and Nupur never stops to amaze us. Her designs are flawless and the flavors are lip smacking. She doesn’t go overboard with sugar and its just the right amount. All her bakes are fresh and her attention to detail is amazing!! There never had been a birthday in our home without a cake from her and never a party without guests raving about the cake. Our favorite is rasmalai tresleches! All we ever give her is a general idea/sample pic of the theme and the flavor and she comes up with amazing designs herself! Lina Husienzad Absolutely stunning cake for my gender reveal! Cake was moist and fluffy, tasted amazing in addition to how beautiful it was. I showed a Pinterest inspiration photo and Nupur delivered with a stunning cake! she really works with you to make something beautiful based on your budget and needs. I also custom ordered gender reveal themed cookies from her which were gorgeous and beautifully wrapped. Great attention to detail, will definitely order from her again! Phenomenal service! Ushasree Adari Cake is yummy and delicious. I am so happy to order the cake here for my daughters birthday. It looks so nice and tasty. All guests loved it. We also got cup cakes and they are good too. Drove 100 miles to get the cake and every mile of journey was worth. Mansi Singh Nupur!!! I can't tell you enough... your cakes are perfect! Everyone raves about your cakes. The presentation, the taste, the flavors... I wouldn't change one thing. You've done a great job. Thank you so much for everything and for making all of our events super memorable. We still talk about your tandai cake. Can't wait to try new flavors!! Neha Hello Nupur. Just wanted to let you know that we had the ras malai cake today. It was simply delicious!! We had not experienced something like this before and were so pleasantly surprised by the taste and texture of the cake. Our guests also enjoyed it immensely. Renuka Vohra All hands down for the delicious cake Nupur! Can't wait to taste the next cake I'm going to order. Maria Anna loved the cake. Beautifully decorated. We also tried the Eggless Rose Tres Leches which we all loved and the Russian Honey which Anna loved. Have to try the Cream cheese Guava loaf cake still. Can't wait!
