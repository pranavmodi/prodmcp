Business Impact: Projected to lift visit volume 12%, recover $500k revenue, and save 1.5 FTE annually. ð¯ Priority 2: Integrated Care Navigator Agent (ICNA) Addresses: Seamless Whole-Person Care Coordination Use Case: Agent ingests CCD documents, lab HL7 feeds, and behavioral health notes; generates unified plans, routes tasks to EHR inboxes, messages patients, and flags unmanaged conditions for care-manager escalation. Business Impact: Expected to reduce per-patient coordination time 20%, avoid $300k in duplicate services, and improve UDS quality scores 8 points. Expected Business Impact Implementation of these AI agent solutions can deliver: 40% reduction in appointment no-shows, translating to approximately $500k annual revenue lift. 20% decrease in clinician coordination time, redeploying 2,500 hours yearly toward direct care. 8-point improvement in HRSA quality metrics, securing an estimated $300k performance payment and reputational advantage.
