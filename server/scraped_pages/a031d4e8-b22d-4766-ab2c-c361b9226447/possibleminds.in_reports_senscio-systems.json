With roughly 80 employees, the firm occupies a niche leadership position in New England but faces intensifying competition from nationally scaled RPM platforms pursuing the same CMS reimbursement tailwinds. Rapid membership growth has strained clinician coaches and highlighted gaps in EHR interoperability, while a relationship-driven, regional GTM model is slowing enterprise pipeline expansion and delaying ARR realisation.

Business Impact: +$10 M incremental ARR in 18 months; 35 % reduction in BD cost per opportunity. ð¯ Priority 2: Ibis Care Copilot Addresses: Multiply Clinician Capacity via AI Care-Coach Copilots Use Case: Embed triage, summarization, and documentation agents inside the existing Ibis portal; connect to sensor streams via AWS HealthLake and push finalized notes into Cerner/Epic through HL7/FHIR APIs. Business Impact: 55 % drop in clinician documentation time; 12 pp gross-margin expansion as membership scales. Expected Business Impact Implementation of these AI agent solutions can deliver: 3Ã increase in qualified enterprise pipeline and 30 % lower customer-acquisition cost within 12 months. 50 % reduction in clinician labor hours per member per month, supporting 2Ã membership growth without headcount increase. 3-point lift in STAR/HEDIS adherence, unlocking an estimated $4 M in shared-savings and quality bonuses annually.
