(IHA) is a 35-year-old government services contractor that delivers occupational, aerospace and environmental health programs, earning an estimated $40â50 M in annual revenueâ95 % of which comes from NASA centers under fixed-price and IDIQ contracts. Competing with larger federal health integrators and agile staffing boutiques, IHA occupies a lower-mid-market niche yet faces rising digital-capability expectations across the federal medical services space. Rapid expansion to Langley, Kennedy and Johnson centers has exposed paper-driven compliance workflows and multi-state clinician shortages, inflating overhead and risking SLA penalties. Heavy dependence on a single customer magnifies the threat of recompete losses, while limited business-development capacity constrains diversification into DoD or VA health portfolios.

Targeted AI agents can remove IHAâs labor-intensive bottlenecks and amplify its contract-capture capacity, delivering scalable efficiency unavailable through traditional process improvements alone. â¢ Automate Compliance & Reporting to Safeguard NASA Revenue: A retrieval-augmented LLM agent that ingests clinical notes, equipment logs and cost data to auto-generate NASA Form 533, QA narratives and FAR/DFARS dashboards will cut reporting labor by 60 %, drive audit findings below one per year, and secure the ~$40 M core revenue stream. â¢ AI-Driven Talent & Contract Expansion Engine: An AI platform that instantly matches cleared clinicians to site-specific credential rules and auto-drafts 70 % of proposal volumes from live SAM.gov feeds will shrink time-to-hire by 40 %, double bid throughput, and unlock $20â25 M in new federal health contracts within 24 months. Strategic Imperative 1: Automate Compliance & Reporting to Safeguard NASA Revenue ð Context: >90 % of IHAâs sales depend on flawlessly meeting NASAâs FAR/DFARS and medical-quality metrics, yet compliance preparation is still paper-driven and labor-intensive. ð AI Agent Opportunity: An LLM-powered regulatory intelligence agent can continuously ingest encounter notes, lab results, scheduling logs and equipment calibration records from EHRs, SharePoint folders and site spreadsheets, then auto-map each data element to the correct FAR clause or NASA KPI template. Using retrieval-augmented generation, the agent drafts Form 533 cost reports, Environmental Health Trend memos and Quality Assurance narratives, flagging missing data in real time for staff to correct. The agent reasons over historical audit outcomes to predict high-risk gaps and proactively generates remediation tasks, routing them to responsible clinicians through MS Teams or mobile app. A reinforcement-learning loopâfed by auditor feedback filesâcontinuously sharpens extraction accuracy and clause interpretation, creating a proprietary compliance knowledge graph that competitors cannot replicate without IHAâs 35-year data corpus. Day-to-day, clinicians finish a patient encounter; within seconds the agent surfaces a pre-filled NASA Clinical Encounter XML, submits it through the Secure File Gateway, and updates a live dashboard for program managersâcutting cycle time from days to minutes and virtually eliminating penalty exposure. ð° Expected Impact: 50-60 % reduction in compliance labor hours (â$2.4 M annual savings), 90 % faster audit turnaround, and <2 % risk of KPI breach, protecting $40-50 M in core revenue. Strategic Imperative 2: AI-Driven Talent & Contract Expansion Engine ð Context: Recruiting cleared clinicians across VA/TX/FL is slow, and 95 % revenue concentration on NASA exposes IHA to recompete risk. ð AI Agent Opportunity: A dual-mode agent can ingest licensure databases, clearance status APIs, professional networks, and historical candidate performance to instant-rank applicants against NASA medical clauses and site rosters. It auto-generates personalized outreach, schedules video prescreens, and writes credentialing packets that feed directly into HRIS and contract staffing matricesâcompressing time-to-fill for RNs, NPs and industrial hygienists.
