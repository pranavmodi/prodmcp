The company sits at the nexus of value-based kidney care and population health, with early statewide contracts in Florida and Arizona positioning it as a rising challenger in the Medicare Advantage and Medicaid CKD markets. Intensifying competition from dialysis giants expanding into CMS Kidney Care Choices and well-funded startups like Evergreen Health heightens pressure to win partners and prove superior outcomes. Rapid geographic roll-outs have strained Duoâs 40-50-person organisation, revealing gaps in business-development bandwidth and in the logistics of coordinating multidisciplinary, in-home care at scale. Backed by Chicago Pacific Founders and fortified by recent C-suite hires, Duo now enters a pivotal scale-up phase where data-driven growth and flawless operational execution will determine national viability. AI agents tailored to Duo can simultaneously target the most valuable payer-provider partnerships and orchestrate end-to-end home-based care workflows, converting the companyâs data advantage into faster market penetration and stronger medical margins. â¢ Accelerate Market Expansion via Data-Driven Partner Acquisition: A growth-automation AI agent that fuses multi-payer claims, CMS CKD prevalence and nephrologist-density data will rank the top 50 untapped markets, auto-generate savings-projection pitch decks, and reduce Duoâs partner-signing cycle by 40% while adding an estimated $150 million in annual capitated revenue within two years. â¢ Drive Operational Excellence in Home-Based Care Coordination: A care-orchestration AI agent that optimises clinician routing, auto-completes documentation and flags rising-risk patients in real time will raise home-visit capacity per NP by 25%, cut avoidable admissions by 15%, and expand medical margin by 3â4 percentage points across the Arizona and Florida cohorts. Strategic Imperative 1: Accelerate Market Expansion via Data-Driven Partner Acquisition ð Context: Winning additional payer and nephrology partners is Duoâs growth engine, yet market prioritization and deal cycles remain labor-intensive and slow. ð AI Agent Opportunity: AI growth agents can continuously ingest multi-payer claims feeds, CMS cost reports, and public CKD prevalence data to score every U.S. county on âaddressable CKD value.â The agent triages prospects by potential medical-cost savings, MA penetration, and existing nephrology density, then auto-generates a dynamic target list for the BD team. It can draft personalized outreach packetsâcomplete with predicted savings, cohort benchmarking, and contract archetypesâusing large-language-model (LLM) templating. A negotiation-support micro-agent simulates risk corridors and stop-loss scenarios in real time, shortening actuarial back-and-forth. Because the underlying scoring model learns from Duoâs closed-won and lost deals, precision improves with each cycle, creating an expanding proprietary dataset that competitors lack. ð° Expected Impact: Reduce partner sourcing time 50%, double annual contract signings, and add 10,000 covered CKD lives within 18 months. Strategic Imperative 2: Drive Operational Excellence in Home-Based Care Coordination ð Context: Rapid multi-state growth strains care team scheduling, documentation, and intervention prioritization, risking cost overruns under capitation. ð AI Agent Opportunity: A care-orchestrator agent can integrate EHR, claims, remote-monitoring, and social-determinant feeds to produce a living patient acuity queue updated daily. Reinforcement-learning algorithms optimize clinician routingâbalancing travel time, visit urgency, and licensure rulesâto raise daily visit capacity. During visits, an on-device LLM listens, auto-generates SOAP notes, recommends guideline-concordant actions, and files documentation directly into Duoâs systems, slashing after-work charting. A parallel supply-chain sub-agent pre-orders labs, meds, or transportation based on predicted needs, preventing avoidable ER visits.

Business Impact: Estimated $120M incremental contract value over 3 years by doubling annual deal volume while trimming acquisition cost per contract by 35%. ð¯ Priority 2: âCare Orchestratorâ Field Automation Agent Addresses: Drive Operational Excellence in Home-Based Care Coordination Use Case: Generates optimal daily care-team routes, real-time patient risk alerts, and voice-to-EHR documentation; triggers automatic orders and community-resource referrals, all inside Duoâs existing Salesforce Health Cloud instance. Business Impact: $8M annual medical-cost savings from 15% fewer unplanned admits and $3M labor savings by boosting clinician productivity 25% without head-count growth. Expected Business Impact Implementation of these AI agent solutions can deliver: 2Ã increase in covered CKD lives, driving projected $120M additional revenue within 36 months. 15% reduction in total medical cost of care for enrolled members, enhancing gross margin by 6 percentage points. 25% uplift in clinician productivity, enabling national scalability without proportional staffing cost.
