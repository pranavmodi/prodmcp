Strategic Analysis: SOUTHLAND CARE COORDINATION PARTNERS, INC. Executive Summary Southland Care Coordination Partners, Inc. (SCCP) is a physician-led network that contracts on value-based terms with Illinois Medicaid MCOs and Medicare Advantage plans, coordinating care for ~40,000 high-risk beneficiaries through a mix of remote and field-based nurses and social workers. The firm, recently NCQA-accredited, competes against larger national population-health vendors and payer-run programs but differentiates with documented outcome improvements such as a 15 % reduction in ED visits. SCCP is in a regional expansion phaseâtargeting downstate Illinois and adjacent Midwest marketsâyet growth is constrained by manual quality-data workflows and reliance on payer RFP cycles.

Business Impact: 50% fewer documentation minutes per encounter, 2Ã outreach capacity per FTE, and projected $800k annual savings from reduced turnover and improved shared-savings payouts. Expected Business Impact Implementation of these AI agent solutions can deliver: 60% faster NCQA and Medicaid quality reporting, protecting ~$4 M in value-based revenue. 50% reduction in coordinator admin time, freeing 20k hours annually for direct member engagement.
