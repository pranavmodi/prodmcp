There never had been a birthday in our home without a cake from her and never a party without guests raving about the cake. Our favorite is rasmalai tresleches!

Her designs are flawless and the flavors are lip smacking. She doesn\u2019t go overboard with sugar and its just the right amount. All her bakes are fresh and her attention to detail is amazing!! There never had been a birthday in our home without a cake from her and never a party without guests raving about the cake. Our favorite is rasmalai tresleches! All we ever give her is a general idea/sample pic of the theme and the flavor and she comes up with amazing designs herself!\n\n##### Lina Husienzad"}, {"url": "https://chocolatetherapy.us/album/babyshowers#model_test_9", "title": "", "snippet": "Absolutely stunning cake for my gender reveal!
